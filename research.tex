    As a scientist I thrive off the challenge of the unknown. I love working in
    new fields and using the breadth of my experience to provide insights into
    novel problems.

    Previously I have worked in the fields of computer vision, transcriptiomics,
    phenomics, genomics, mathematical modelling, data analytics and molecular
    transport. I pick up new skills quickly and also enjoy mentoring and passing
    on the knowledge I have obtained.
